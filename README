mephisto_relative_time
======================

If you have a date but don't want to display it all ugly like in your blog, 
this filter will let you convert that date to a 'real words' representation.

installation
============

    script/plugin install -x http://svn.dnite.org/mephisto_relative_time

of course, you don't need the -x, but if your using svn, you might as well 
add this to your externals so you always have to latest and greatest version.
Don't forget to restart mephisto to get this plugin to enable itself.

usage
=====

Using this filter is easy. The following are a few examples.

    Something happened {{ date_variable | relative_time_ago }} ago.
    My birthday was {{ "2006-07-17" | relative_time_ago }} ago.
    My birthday is in {{ "2007-07-17" | relative_time_to }}!

That easy. Enjoy!
